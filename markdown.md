# Ten Ten Zero (10100)

## What is a Ten-Ten-Zero app?

- _Ten weeks to go-live_ - Build an MVP and meet all go-live hurdles in ten weeks

- _Ten years evergreen_ - Apps are upgraded and modern for at least ten years. Not just live, they will be migrated to the latest platforms and frameworks so they dont end up in the "legacy bucket"

- _Zero ops_ - Do away with expensive AM contracts full of low cost offshore developers

---

## TTZ apps are lower cost

Invest in build costs only. Infrastructure and operatations are automated

---

## Traditional upgrade cycle

Apps written in traditional enterprise DotNet or Java frameworks are trapped in an upgrade cycle

## Why do I need this?

- A business customer that wants to expore a product opportunity fast, and doesnt have months to produre a costly IT system

- Legacy systems were not built with evergreen in mind. Many of them need rewrites for the cloud.

- Many software platforms are out of date e.g. Microsoft .Net Framework, Java 9 & 10 will not be LTS, desktop apps, etc

## How

- Atos will invest half of the MVP build to show how much can be done in 5 weeks
- The MVP is a fixed price if the client chooses to continue
- Low risk as clients will see the app being built daily. We will have a real-time 'model office' to test

          <h2>Why do I need this?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A business customer that wants to expore a product opportunity
              fast, and doesnt have months to produre a costly IT system
            </li>
            <li>
              Legacy systems were not built with evergreen in mind. Many of them
              need rewrites for the cloud.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many software platforms are out of date e.g. Microsoft .Net
              Framework, Java 9 & 10 will not be LTS, desktop apps, etc
            </li>

          <h2>How</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Atos will invest half of the MVP build to show how much can be
              done in 5 weeks
            </li>
            <li>The MVP is a fixed price if the client chooses to continue</li>
            <li>
              Low risk as clients will see the app being built daily. We will
              have a real-time 'model office' to test
            </li>

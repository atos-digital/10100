          <h2>What is a 10-10-0 app?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>10 weeks to go-live:</strong> Build an MVP and meet all
              go-live hurdles in ten weeks
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>10 years evergreen:</strong> Apps are upgraded and modern
              for at least ten years. Not just live, they will be migrated to
              the latest platforms and frameworks so they dont end up in the
              "legacy bucket"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>0 ops:</strong> Do away with expensive AM contracts full
              of low cost offshore developers
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>10100 apps are lower cost</h2>

          Invest in build costs only. Infrastructure and operatations are
          automated

        <section>
          <h2>Traditional upgrade cycle</h2>

          Apps written in traditional enterprise DotNet or Java frameworks are
          trapped in an upgrade cycle

            <img src="img/upgrade_cycle.png" />
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Why do I need this?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A business customer that wants to expore a product opportunity
              fast, and doesnt have months to produre a costly IT system
            </li>
            <li>
              Legacy systems were not built with evergreen in mind. Many of them
              need rewrites for the cloud.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many software platforms are out of date e.g. Microsoft .Net
              Framework, Java 9 & 10 will not be LTS, desktop apps, etc
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Atos will invest half of the MVP build to show how much can be
              done in 5 weeks
            </li>
            <li>The MVP is a fixed price if the client chooses to continue</li>
            <li>
              Low risk as clients will see the app being built daily. We will
              have a real-time 'model office' to test
            </li>
